For example, if the target steps through a phantasmal bridge and survives the fall, it believes the bridge exists and something else caused it to fall.\nAn affected target can even take damage from the illusion if the phantasm represents a dangerous creature or hazard. On each of your turns, such a phantasm can deal 2d8 Psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm.
